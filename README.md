The term "Machine Learning" was coined by an American Computer scientist named Arthur Samuel in 1959.

Machine Learning finds it’s applications everywhere in the digital era- Machine Learning is at the core of your email accounts helping you filter spam messages and other unwanted emails, it is at the heart of growing search power of iPhone’s Siri, it is in your Smartphone helping you organize and classify your photos, it is on Walmart recommending you products based on preferences to customize your shopping experience. Gadgets, Equipment’s and all other services in the digital era are getting smarter by helping humans make decisions based on recommended practices and data trends.

# Linear Regression

which is a linear approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. 

The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. 

For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression. (This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.)

# Logistic Regression

It is a regression model where the dependent variable (DV) is categorical and the output can take only two values, "0" and "1".
