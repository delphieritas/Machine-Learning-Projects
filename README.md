The term "Machine Learning" was coined by an American Computer scientist named Arthur Samuel in 1959.

Machine Learning finds it’s applications everywhere in the digital era- Machine Learning is at the core of your email accounts helping you filter spam messages and other unwanted emails, it is at the heart of growing search power of iPhone’s Siri, it is in your Smartphone helping you organize and classify your photos, it is on Walmart recommending you products based on preferences to customize your shopping experience. Gadgets, Equipment’s and all other services in the digital era are getting smarter by helping humans make decisions based on recommended practices and data trends.

# Supervised and unsupervised algorithms

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables and clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data


# Linear Regression

which is a linear approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. 

The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. 

For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression. (This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.)

# Logistic Regression

It is a regression model where the dependent variable (DV) is categorical and the output can take only two values, "0" and "1".

# K Nearest Neighbors

In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression.

Classification: An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.

Regression: the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors.

# Decision Tree and Random Forest

classification trees: Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values.
regression trees: Tree models where the target variable can take continuous values.

Random forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.

# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

A supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.
